# Downloading docker

# Cloning the repository

```bash snippet
git clone https://github.com/OwnLogs/ownlogs && cd ownlogs
```

# Starting docker

To start your own OwnLogs instance, you first need to configure it. Please refer to the [configuring](/docs/Configuration/General-config) page.

Then run the `run.sh` script :

```bash snippet
./run.sh
```

This script will set environment variables and pass them to the containers and build the containers.
